So i was going keep developing my own semi-static site CMS, [WebGizmo 2](https://github.com/awhillas/webgizmo2), which was writen in PHP, but given that PHP is going the way of the dodo and i takes me half a day to remomber how to write it again, and it was just a way to practice OO design I'm thinking I'll rewrite in Python at some point but just want to start publishing my notes again, not as a blog but as one off pages.

This is using [Pelican](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/) which lets me keep my content in Markdown and I can switch the CMS in the future without lock in.
